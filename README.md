# Laravel Newsletter Page

This is a simple project made in Laravel with a focus on building a Laravel App using Sail, configuring the environment and creating simple backend functionality.

The idea was that there is a Rest API service that provides us with Posts/News. There is a cronjob that runs once a day and updates the database with the latest data. Data is pulled from our database and displayed on frontend. Database can be updated manually or automatically.
